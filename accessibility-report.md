### For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining 
### which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, 
### you can either:
### - Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle.
### - Discuss a limitation of your program in terms of the principle and identify how you might address 
###   the limitation.
### - Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.
EQUITABLE USE
- The software is designed with an intuitive interface to ensure that all users, regardless of their 
  abilities, can access and complete the hotel booking and booking management processes. 
- Furthermore, our user interface is simple and minimal with no bright flashy colors or common colors 
  associated with color blindness (red-green), this may be beneficial for individuals with color 
  blindness or other visual impairments and sensitivities.
- Our application currently lacks multilingual support. More robust language options would be a 
  great feature to add in the future, to avoid unintentionally neglecting a big group of potential 
  users. 
- Because it is text-heavy and doesn’t have any pictures, a feature the team could implement in the 
  future would be dyslexia font to aid dyslexic users.

FLEXIBILITY IN USE
- Our software is a bit limited when it comes to how to use it. Our booking processes in particular 
  don’t really feature a lot of different ways for guests to search for rooms or event halls beyond 
  either the room type or the results of the forecasted weather for their event date. Our room 
  service feature also has a limited means of using it: from a limited list of meals, you order each 
  meal by inputting the desired quantity. 
- So, for the future, we can look into implementing a feature that allows users to search for rooms 
  using a variety of filters, such as price range, room type, and amenities. Similarly, we could 
  implement a feature that allows users to search for meals using filters like vegan, vegetarian, 
  halal, salads, mains, etc.
- However, our accommodations feature is quite flexible. Users are free to input whatever they’d like 
  and don’t have to choose from a limited list of possible accommodation services. 

SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE USE
- We made sure that the design for our software was as simple and intuitive as possible while still 
  maintaining the required functionality. Users are given clear prompts when they have to input data 
  and none of the processes are unnecessarily long or complicated.

PERCEPTIBLE INFORMATION
- The software provides confirmation messages and booking summaries after a successful booking, as 
  well as warnings if any inputted data is formatted incorrectly or left blank.
- Error messages are displayed clearly, with simple and precise language, ensuring that users 
  can quickly understand and fix issues.
- For future improvement, we could include more pictorial representations (e.g icons) for some of 
  the features and important information, to ensure that all users are able to understand the 
  information being presented to them.

TOLERANCE FOR ERROR
- We display errors before users move onto the next view in the case that their inputted data was 
  formatted incorrectly or left black.
- However, we currently do not have a feature that provides a confirmation step before finalizing a 
  check out, booking, order or accommodation specification, allowing users to review their selections 
  and correct any mistakes. That would be an important feature to add in the future.
- Another good feature to add in the future would be the ability to modify or cancel bookings within 
  a certain timeframe, reducing the impact of accidental errors.

LOW PHYSICAL EFFORT
- Our program is simply a software application users can open and use on their devices. In that way, 
  we could say that there is extremely low physical effort associated with it.
- Users are able to perform tasks efficiently with a few clicks or text fields that require simple 
  input.

SIZE AND SPACE FOR APPROACH AND USE
- Again, our program is just a software application, so it’s confined to the user’s device. As such, 
  it doesn’t require any extra space and can easily accommodate the user’s position or their day-to-day
  use of assistive devices or personal assistance.
- The layout is simple, ensuring that users can navigate the interface without feeling overwhelmed. 
  Buttons and text fields are appropriately sized for easy selection.
- A good feature to add for the future could be to extend the user interface to adapt to different 
  screen sizes, ensuring that users can comfortably interact with it on both desktop and mobile 
  devices.

### Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were 
### to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such 
### as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail 
### along with the category.
- Hypothetically, we would market our program towards anyone planning on needing a place to stay or 
  venue to book in Zurich, Switzerland. In this situation, users would know that they want to book 
  with The Infinite Inn specifically, and go straight to the application.
- More realistically, people can use our program as a starting point for implementing similar 
  software for an actual hotel or inn.
- With the private event booking feature, other establishments that advertise themselves as event 
  venues can also use our program as a starting point for implementing similar software.

### Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain 
### demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics 
### modules this term.
- The hotel booking and management system may be less likely to be used by older individuals, or 
  anyone who isn’t as familiar or comfortable with technology and prefers to complete inn/event 
  bookings more traditionally, i.e over the phone or in person.
- There may be some people who may be less inclined to use remote check-out or digital 
  accommodations because they prefer face-to-face interactions with hotel staff. However, in 
  this day and age, there is an increasing preference among the majority of people to be able to do 
  everything remotely. So for most people, this feature would actually be very appealing.
