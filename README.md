### Purpose
This project implements hotel booking and management software for The Infinite Inn, a fictional inn 
located in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland with an infinite number of rooms. Our software 
streamlines the booking and management process for either a room or private event by allowing users 
to do everything remotely and in one place without dealing with long wait times or phone calls. 
Users are able to use our software to book a room or book out one of the event halls as a venue for 
private events. Users can then specify any needed accommodations and order room service or catering 
from a set list of meals. At the end of their stay, users can check out of 
their room or event hall once their stay is over. 

### Features/User Stories
#### Team:
- As a guest, I want to be able to log into my room booking to gain access to ordering room 
service, specifying accommodations, or checking out of my room.
- As a client, I want to be able to log into my event booking to gain access to ordering catering, 
specifying accommodations, or checking out of my event hall.
#### Aeysha:
- As a client, I want to be able to book out one of the private event rooms at the inn so that I 
can host an event, such as a wedding or small conference, without actually staying at the inn as a 
guest.
#### Ayusha:
- As a potential guest, I want to be able to make a booking at the inn so that I can secure a place 
to stay during my trip according to my preferences.
#### Emily:
- As a guest or a client, once my trip or event is over, I want to check out of my room or the 
event hall on my phone remotely so that I can leave on my own time.
#### Noga:
- As a guest, I want to order room service so that I can get food delivered without having to leave 
my room.
- As a guest, I want to order catering from the inn so that I don't have to worry about getting 
food from some outside service.
#### Olivia:
- As a guest or client, I want to specify any accommodations I need for my stay to let staff know 
of my personal needs in advance or as they change.
