### Purpose
This project implements hotel booking and management software for The Infinite Inn, a fictional inn located in Zurich, Switzerland with an infinite number of rooms. Our software 
streamlines the booking and management process for either a room or private event by allowing users to do everything remotely without dealing with long wait times or phone calls. Everything is found
in one place. Users are able to use our software to book a room, specify any needed accommodations and order room service from a set list of meals. At the end of their stay, users can check out of their room. Non-guests are also able to book out the inn as a venue for private events, and check-out of the event hall once everything is over.
